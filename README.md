# Course 4 Peer Assignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This repo contains: 1) the code file run_analysis.R that creates a tidy dataset, 2) the  tidy dataset output of run_analysis.R, and 3) a code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and the work performed to clean up the data.
